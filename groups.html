            <p class="data">
                Before we can dive into groups, we first must know a few things. The first is what a set is.
                <br>
                A set is a list of items, it can be ordered or unordered. There are a few ways to notate a set, one includes curly
                braces. Anything in the set goes in the curly braces separated by commas, these are called the elements of the set.
                <br><br>For example, $S = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$. A set is usually denoted by a capital letter. A set can hold anything, another example
                of a set is $F$ where $F = \{\bigcirc, \Box, \bigtriangleup\}$. A set can even hold other sets, $\mathfrak{E} = \{ \{ A,B,C\}, \{ D,E,F\} \}$.
            </p>
            <h3 class="idea">Set Operations</h3>
            <p class="data">
                Sets have operations and relations on them just like numbers. Similar to how $4\lt5$ or $4+3\gt1$, sets have relations like 
                $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R}$, $\{1,2,3,4\} \cup \{0,4,5,6\} = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. First we will go over the operations and relations
                then some famous sets.
                <br><br>
                The symbol $\subseteq$ is the <em>subset</em> symbol. A set $S$ is a <em>subset</em> of another set, $X$,
                if $X$ contains every element in $S$. If $X$ contains some elements not in $S$ as well, then $S$ is the <em>proper subset</em> of $X$,
                $S\subset X$.
                <br><br>
                The symbol $\supseteq$ is the exact opposite of subset. It is the <em>superset</em> symbol. A superset $X$ of a set $S$ contains
                all the elements of $S$ and possibly more, $X \supseteq S$.
                <br><br>
                $\cup$ is the union symbol. It is an operator that combines sets like a venn diagram. The union of two sets, $X$ and $S$, is notated
                as $X \cup S$ and is a new set that contains the elements of both sets with no repeats. If each set is one circle of the venn diagram
                then the union of the sets is the set containing both of the circles of the venn diagram.
                <br><br>
                $\cap$ is the intersection symbol. It is an operator that cuts sets like a venn diagram. The intersection of two sets, $X$ and $S$,
                is notated as $X \cap S$ and is a new set that contains only elements that both $X$ and $S$ have in common. In the venn diagram example,
                the intersection is the part in the middle that touches both circles.
                <br><br>
                Finally, $\in$ is the set inclusion operator. It is a binary operator with an element on the left and a set on the right. It denotes
                when an object is an element of a set. For example, $1 \in \{1,2,3\}$ but $1 \notin \{0,2,4,6,8,...\}$.
            </p>
            <h3 class="idea">Famous Numerical Sets</h3>
            <p class="data">
                $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all natural numbers ($1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, ...); it is debated whether or not $\mathbb{N}$ includes 0.
                <br>$\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers (..., $-3$, $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, ...).
                <br>$\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of all rational numbers ($1 \over 2$, $164$, $-18.965$, and more), 
                numbers of the form $a \over b$ when $a$ and $b$ are both integers and $b \neq 0$.
                <br>$\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers ($e$, $-54.154$, $\pi$, $\gamma$).
                <br>$\mathbb{C}$ is the set of all complex numbers, ($4-3i$, $12.554i$, $e-\pi i$).
                <br>$\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$
